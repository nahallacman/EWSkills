# EWSkills
Basically LeetCode for embedded C code practice.

All of the problems can be found at: [https://www.ewskills.com/topic/embedded-c](https://www.ewskills.com/topic/embedded-c)

I will be solving the problems one at a time, assuming that the user will input the files on the command line manually.

# Future Plans
Create a wrapper to automatically test all of these problems using the examples the website provides.

I did not write any of these problems, they are all from the EWSkills website so please respect their license agreement. Only the solutions are my original work and applicable to the license agreement on this repository.
